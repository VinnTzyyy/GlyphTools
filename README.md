## 📖 How to Use
1. Open the tool in your browser or use the link above.
2. Click **IMPORT GLYPH FROM FILES** or drag & drop your glyph image.

   - File name
   - Image dimensions
   - A 16×16 grid of all glyphs
4. Click on any glyph tile to copy its character to your clipboard.

💡 **Tip:**

- It's recommended to name your file with the **starting hex code** (e.g., `E100.png` → starts from `\uE100`) so the tool calculates the correct unicode.
